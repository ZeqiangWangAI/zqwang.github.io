I will update `README.md` to match the content of the personal homepage, as requested.

1.  **Update `README.md`**:
    *   Replace the current "Hamilton Theme" documentation with Zeqiang Wang's profile information.
    *   Include the English and Chinese bio.
    *   Include the CV download links.
    *   Add the "About Me" section.

2.  **Verify `index.html`**:
    *   Ensure `index.html` (which is the actual entry point for the deployed website) is still correct and aligned with the README content. (No changes needed if it is already correct, but I will double-check).

**Note**: The user correctly pointed out that for the GitHub repository view (https://github.com/zqwang/zqwang.github.io), the `README.md` is what is displayed. I will make sure this file reflects the personal profile. The `index.html` remains the entry point for the deployed GitHub Pages site (https://zqwang.github.io). Updating both ensures consistency across both views.
